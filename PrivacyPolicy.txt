StreetlightSeattleReporter keeps no personal data from its users. The android 
permissions READ_PHONE_STATE and READ_CONTACTS are only used to automatically
fill the user's name and phone number into the streetlight problem
notification form. The user is free to change these fields if they so desire.
The values in these fields are sent to Seattle City Light when the user
submits their problem report.
