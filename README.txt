Would you like to alert Seattle City Light to a burned out streetlight you notice while on the move in Seattle? Then the new Streetlight Seattle Reporter app is for you! And with the addition of Google's free ZXing bar code scanner to your camera-containing Android platform, you can simply scan in the streetlight bar codes instead of keying in their 7-digit ids. Without ZXing, you are redirected to the Google Play store to add that functionality if you try using the bar code scanner.

Overall, the Streetlight Seattle Reporter app is an excellent supplement to the City of Seattle's "Find It, Fix It" app, which facilitates communication on such problems as potholes, graffiti, and abandoned vehicles.
